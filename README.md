# My Android Sketch

Hi all. Here I practice with all the recent libraries, frameworks, architecture and methodologies to make the best Android application.

All I needed was a data source to play with which I found in themoviedb.org.

I have till now implemented folowing features:

1. RxJava
2. Retrofit
3. Infinite Pagination
4. MVVM LiveData and Data Binding

I keep updating the codebase. Feel free to navigate in the application to check out all the features!!
